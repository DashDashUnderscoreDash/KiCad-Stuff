### __These are libraries that I use when I'm making boards in KiCad__

I've set this up with, what I hope is, a logical form of organization:
1. Buttons
2. Connectors
3. Displays
4. Switch footprints

This is WIP as I am adding/making new things on and off, and I want to continue to refine organization
